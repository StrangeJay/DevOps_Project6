# WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS 

You are progressing in practicing to implement web solutions using different technologies. As a DevOps engineer you will most probably encounter [PHP](https://www.php.net/)-based solutions since, even in 2021, it is the dominant web programming language used by more websites than any other programming language.
In this project you will be tasked to prepare storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress). WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in **PHP** and paired with **MySQL** or **MariaDB** as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).  

Project 6 consists of two parts:  
1. Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. The focus of this part is to give you practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.  

2. Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. This part of the project will solidify your skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.  


As a DevOps engineer, your deep understanding of core components of web solutions and your ability to troubleshoot them will play an essential role in your further progress and development.  

## Three-tier Architecture  
Generally, web, or mobile solutions are implemented based on what is called the **Three-tier Architecture.**
Three-tier Architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers. Namely: The presentation layer, the Business layer and the data Access or Management Layer(DAL).

1. **Presentation Layer (PL):** This is the user interface such as the client server or browser on your laptop.  
2. **Business Layer (BL):** This is the backend program that implements business logic. Application or Webserver  
3. **Data Access or Management Layer (DAL):** This is the layer for computer data storage and data access. [Database Server](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/database-server.htm) or File System Server such as [FTP server](https://titanftp.com/2018/09/11/what-is-an-ftp-server/), or [NFS Server](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Network-File-System).
